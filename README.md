# AdsWise.pl blog created with Next.js
  A frontend application created with a modern technology stack:
    - Next.js (configured for Static Site Generation)
    - TypeScript
    - styled-components

  Data for posts and pages is taken from a Wordpress site (Headless CMS) and uploaded by the client's content editor. The CMS uses a GraphQL API plugin for incoming requests.

  The frontend app is based and built on an official Next.js + Wordpress example template.
